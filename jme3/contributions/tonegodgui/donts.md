Things that I suggest NOT doing when using this library:<br />

<br />

1. Unnecessary nesting.<br />

– A panel is a window, not a generic container.<br />

– Unless someone can give me a solid reason why I should reconsider this, there is NO need to create windows, panels, etc as anything but screen level components.  Otherwise, you are creating unnecessary overhead and limiting the potential of your UI.<br />

<br />

g0d has spoken… well, t0neg0d has anyways.<br />

<br />

Eh… I'm tired… more to come later.  In the mean time, DON'T DO #1. <img src="/lib/images/smileys/icon_smile2.gif" class="icon" alt="=)" />
