<blockquote><div class="no">
 I started my game develop career with some basic DirectX examples and pirated 3DSMax 13 years ago, when I was 13. :p Yes, I'm just 26 in 2013. Then I went to 3D Game Studio version A5 to do some fancy drag and drop stuff… From that point I've already got the idea of doing a character customization system in my mind. </div></blockquote>

<p>
The initial idea of Character customization is: We (human) are soooo <strong>similiar</strong>!! 
</p>

<p>
The second idea: <strong>resuable</strong> and <strong>composable</strong>!
</p>
<ol>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Cloths, skins, 3dmodels, animation.. are components of a whole, which made up character</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> The same ideas with component oriented architecture</div>
</li>
</ol>

<p>
So to reduce a very big workload of data and assets need for a game with vast data of character (football players, etc…) More over we can support and encourage gamer to “build” their own character! This is how we handle the situations, similiar scenario can happen in a MMOs.
