<p>
If you've been working on a large scene in the SDK, there is a good chance that you will need to increase the size of Java's heap space (which is quite small by default). <a href="http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/jw-08-1996/jw-08-gc.html" class="urlextern" title="http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/jw-08-1996/jw-08-gc.html" rel="nofollow">What is heap space?</a>
</p>

<p>
To increase the amount of heap space allocated to the SDK, we must navigate to the SDK's installation directory and edit the etc/jmonkeyplatform.conf file.
</p>

<p>
The installation directory for Mac and Windows is:
</p>

<p>
<strong><abbr title="Operating System">OS</abbr> X:</strong> Applications/jmonkeyplatform.app/Contents/Resources/jmonkeyplatform/jmonkeyplatform
</p>

<p>
<strong>Windows:</strong> C:\Program Files\jmonkeyplatform
