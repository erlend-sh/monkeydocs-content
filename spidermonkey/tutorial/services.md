The service system is meant to create a common way of using plugins. It is a tiny system, on Server and Client level. In this tutorial I'll tell you how to use services, and how to create your own.

Creating services is really easy - you just have to implement the Service interface. <strong>Make sure you don't do anything time consuming</strong> since the developer may not be expecting it. Services can choose to support Server, Client, or both. To implement this, use the appropriate constructors:
</p>
<pre class="code java"><span class="kw1">public</span> <span class="kw1">class</span> MyExampleService <span class="kw1">implements</span> Service <span class="br0">{</span>
   <span class="kw1">public</span> MyExampleService<span class="br0">(</span>Server server<span class="br0">)</span> <span class="br0">{</span>
      <span class="co1">// By adding the constructor with the Server as argument, this service</span>
      <span class="co1">//  now supports servers.</span>
   <span class="br0">}</span>
Â 
   <span class="kw1">public</span> MyExampleService<span class="br0">(</span>Client client<span class="br0">)</span> <span class="br0">{</span>
      <span class="co1">// Same goes for client. I could just leave this constructor out, and</span>
      <span class="co1">//  SpiderMonkey would determine this service does not support client mode.</span>
   <span class="br0">}</span>
<span class="br0">}</span></pre>

<p>
The Server and Client class both have a method called getService(). It retrieves a service based on class name, and instantiates it if necessary. From there you can use the service.
</p>

<p>
The Service system is not a terribly powerful system, neither does it do safety checks and service management - it just provides a way to commonly manage extensions.
